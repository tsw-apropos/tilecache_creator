=================

Create local disk cache from WMS service for offline use in QGIS from online wms sources in Spherical Mercator Projection (EPSG:3857). 

Requires owslib.wms. This is most easily installed with either easy_install or pip (Under Linux these tools can be found in the python-setuptools package or as sometimes as python-pip, depending on your distro)

Please note that other projections are not supported and attempting to download them will generate an error.
